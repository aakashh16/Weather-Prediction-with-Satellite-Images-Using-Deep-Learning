# Weather-Prediction-with-Satellite-Images-Using-Deep-Learning

# Overview
This project leverages deep learning and Python to analyze satellite images for weather prediction. Traditional forecasting models rely on numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods, which require high computational power and struggle with short-term forecasting. In contrast, our approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Python-based machine learning frameworks to improve forecasting accuracy.

By processing real-time satellite imagery, the model identifies atmospheric conditions such as cloud formations, temperature variations, and humidity, allowing for more accurate short-term predictions.


# Objectives
- Develop a deep learning-based weather prediction model using satellite imagery.
- Improve accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional numerical weather prediction models.
- Extract meaningful weather features such as cloud formations, temperature trends, and humidity from satellite images.
- Enable real-time weather forecasting by integrating continuously updated satellite data.
- Enhance local weather prediction capabilities by training models on region-specific datasets.

# Dataset
We use publicly available satellite imagery datasets to train and validate our deep learning models.
