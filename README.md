# Weather-Prediction-with-Satellite-Images-Using-Deep-Learning

# Overview
Weather prediction plays a crucial role in various fields such as agriculture, disaster management, and transportation. Traditional forecasting methods rely on numerical models that require extensive computational resources and often struggle with short-term predictions. This project leverages deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), to analyze satellite images and predict weather patterns more accurately.

This approach allows for faster and more localized predictions, making it a powerful alternative to conventional meteorological models. The project utilizes satellite images to identify weather conditions like cloud formations, temperature variations, and atmospheric changes, which are then processed using deep learning models to generate accurate forecasts.
