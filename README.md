# Weather-Prediction-with-Satellite-Images-Using-Deep-Learning

# Overview
This project leverages deep learning and Python to analyze satellite images for weather prediction. Traditional forecasting models rely on numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods, which require high computational power and struggle with short-term forecasting. In contrast, our approach uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Python-based machine learning frameworks to improve forecasting accuracy.

By processing real-time satellite imagery, the model identifies atmospheric conditions such as cloud formations, temperature variations, and humidity, allowing for more accurate short-term predictions.


# Objectives
- Develop a Python-based deep learning model for weather prediction using satellite images.
- Enhance forecasting accuracy by leveraging CNNs for image analysis.
- Process and extract meaningful weather features such as cloud patterns and temperature gradients.
- Enable real-time weather forecasting by integrating continuously updated satellite imagery.
- Compare performance against traditional meteorological models for validation.

# Dataset
We use publicly available satellite imagery datasets to train and validate our deep learning models.

# Code
The implementation includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Loading and normalizing satellite images.
- Deep Learning Model: CNN-based architecture for feature extraction and weather forecasting.
- Training and Evaluation: Using historical data to optimize model accuracy.
- Visualization & Prediction: Graphical analysis of predictions vs. actual weather data.

- Real-time satellite data integration improves forecasting accuracy.
- CNNs are highly effective for image-based weather prediction.
- Handling cloud occlusions and differentiating seasonal variations remain key challenges.

# Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates that Python and deep learning can be used to analyze satellite images for accurate weather prediction. By training CNN models on high-resolution images, we have improved forecasting accuracy, particularly for short-term predictions. The research provides a strong foundation for further AI-driven meteorology advancements.
